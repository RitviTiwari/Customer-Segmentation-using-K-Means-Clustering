# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering

## Project Overview
This project aims to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing behaviors using **K-means clustering**. Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to target specific groups with personalized marketing strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction and business performance.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- **Description**: The dataset contains features such as age, income, spending score, and other demographic or behavioral information that help identify patterns in customer groups.

## Features
- **K-Means Clustering Algorithm**: Used to divide customers into distinct groups based on their similarity.
- **Elbow Method**: Applied to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Visualization**: The results of clustering are visualized through plots like scatter plots and pair plots to better understand customer groupings.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RitviTiwari/your-repository.git
2.Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
## usage
## To run the project:
1.Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.\n


2.Open the .ipynb file (in Google Colab or Jupyter).



3.Run each cell to execute the project. The notebook walks through the process of importing the data, preprocessing, applying K-means clustering, and visualizing the results.
## Results
The dataset was clustered into 5 groups where each cluster represents a unique group of customers with similar purchasing behaviors.
## Technologies Used:
-Python: For data analysis and model implementation.
-Pandas & Numpy: For data manipulation.
-Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
-Sklearn: For implementing K-Means clustering.
